# Analysis of FBI Hate Crime Statistics dataset

## Project Abstract
Using the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics [dataset](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/downloads#datasets) with data on hate crimes in the U.S. from 1991 to 2020, I was able to analyze data specifically on anti-Asian hate crimes. The dataset, with updated 2020 data released in October 2021, consists of 219,577 crimes over the span of 29 years, with 6,462 of those crimes against Asians. 

## Comparing 2019 and 2020

Taking a look at the most recent two years, 2019 and 2020, there was a 68% increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. Note, in the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics Program, victims are an individual, a business/financial institution, a government entity, a religious organization, or society/public as a whole. While we need more data on attacks against Asian females (there were 5 crimes that targeted this demographic in the dataset), the data indicates that there was a 200% increase in attacks against Asian females in 2020 from the previous year. Minnesota and New York saw the greatest increase in anti-Asian crimes at 800% and 400%, respectively. Other states with over 100% increases include Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas, and California. 

The dataset also consists of information on the locations of crimes. Categories include convenience stores, restaurants, schools, parking lots, and parks. 2020 saw a 550% increase in anti-Asian attacks at convenience stores and a 500% increase in grocery/supermarkets. Highway/road/alley/street/sidewalk had the highest frequency of anti-Asian crimes in both years, at 43 and 72 in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

## Conclusion

The data shows that the year 2020, along with a global pandemic, ushered in a wave of xenophobic, anti-Asian sentiment that resulted in a rise in anti-Asian violence. Other datasets show alarming numbers for 2021 as well, indicating the need for greater action to combat the rise of anti-Asian violence.
