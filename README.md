# Analysis of FBI Hate Crime Statistics dataset

## Project summary
Using the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics [dataset](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/downloads#datasets) with data on hate crimes in the U.S. from 1991 to 2020, I was able to analyze data specifically on anti-Asian hate crimes.
